        <section>
            <p>For a long time, the only reliable cross-browser compatible tools available for creating CSS layouts were features like floats and positioning. These work, but in some ways they're also limiting and frustrating.</p>
        </section>
        
        <main>
            <p>The following simple layout designs are either difficult or impossible to achieve with such tools in any kind of convenient, flexible way:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <p>Vertically centering a block of content inside its parent.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Making all the children of a container take up an equal amount of the available width/height, regardless of how much width/height is available.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Making all columns in a multiple-column layout adopt the same height even if they contain a different amount of content.</p>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </main>

            <p>As you'll see in subsequent sections, flexbox makes a lot of layout tasks much easier. Let's dig in!</p>
